		<h2>History of the Software</h2>
		<p>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see <a href="https://www.cwi.nl">http://www.cwi.nl</a>) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.</p>

		<p>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see <a href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us">http://www.cnri.reston.va.us</a>) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.</p>

		<p>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation, see <a href="https://www.zope.org">http://www.zope.com</a>). In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/">http://www.python.org/psf/</a>) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.</p>

		<p>All Python releases are Open Source (see <a href="https://www.opensource.org">http://www.opensource.org</a> for the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.</p>

		<h3>Footnotes:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source. The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.</li>

			<li>According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,     because its license has a choice of law clause. According to     CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is "not incompatible" with the GPL.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.</p>
