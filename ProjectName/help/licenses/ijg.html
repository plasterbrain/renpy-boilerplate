		<p>This distribution contains a release of the Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG software. You are welcome to redistribute this software and to use it for any purpose, subject to the conditions under <span class="caps">Legal Issues</span>, below.</p>

		<p>This software is the work of Tom Lane, Guido Vollbeding, Philip Gladstone, Bill Allombert, Jim Boucher, Lee Crocker, Bob Friesenhahn, Ben Jackson, Julian Minguillon, Luis Ortiz, George Phillips, Davide Rossi, Ge' Weijers, and other members of the Independent JPEG Group.</p>

		<h2 class="caps">Legal Issues</h2>
		<p>In plain English:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!)</li>

			<li>You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.</li>

			<li>You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>In legalese:</p>

		<p>The authors make <span class="caps">no warranty</span> or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided <span class="caps">"as is"</span>, and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.</p>

		<p>This software is copyright &copy; 1991-2016 Thomas G. Lane and Guido Vollbeding. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.</p>

		<p>Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this <span class="caps"><a href="https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/blob/master/README.ijg" aria-label="IJG Readme on Github">readme</a></span> file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.</li>

			<li>If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".</li>

			<li>Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept <span class="caps">no liability</span> for damages of any kind.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.</p>

		<p>Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".</p>

		<p>We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.</p>

		<p>The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.</p>

		<p>We are required to state that</p>
