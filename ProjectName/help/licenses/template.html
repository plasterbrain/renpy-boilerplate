		<p>You can put version info and disclaimers here, as well as information about the organization that made the license, which may not be the same as the licensor.</p>

	<hr>
	<p>Please remember to update the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag with your license name, too.</p>

	<section id="section1">
		<h2>Section Name</h2>
		<p>You can give each section an <code>id</code> attribute to enable linking to sections of a license.</p>

		<p>Any elements with a class name beginning with "param_" will be populated by URL query parameters.</p>

		<p>For example, this text &ndash; <span class="param_year">1776</span> &ndash; has the class "param_year." Linking to this license page with a query like <em>template.html?year=2010</em> will set it to "2010." Give it a try!</p>

		<p>Use the class name "param_copyrights" for multiple copyright author lines. Then specify "years" and "orgs" parameters as comma-separated lists of copyright years and their associated copyright holders, respectively. The "param_copyrights" elements will have a line reading <code>Copyright (C) [year] [name]&lt;br&gt;</code> for every year/name pair you supply.<br/>
