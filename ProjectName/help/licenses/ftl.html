                <p>This  program is referred to as 'a program using the FreeType engine'.</p>

                <p>This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.</p>

                <p>If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.</p>
