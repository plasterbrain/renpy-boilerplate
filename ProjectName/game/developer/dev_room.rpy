    en "I suppose I'm not being fair. The priciest Ren'Py games get is like $25, compared to a $30-40 Japanese visual novel."
    en "That's about the price of a new hardcover book."
    en "It is! I have Barnes and Noble's top-selling books open right here. The number one has an MSRP of $28!"

    en "To say nothing of programming!"
    en "I'm sorry, but while I don't know much about typesetting, it cannot be more difficult than learning Python."
