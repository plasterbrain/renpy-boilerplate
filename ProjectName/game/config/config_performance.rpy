## Configuration: Performance/Graphics Settings
################################################################################
## Settings to control how Ren'Py renders and optimizes graphics and screens.

## -- Caching ------------------------------------------------------------------

init python:

	## --- Image Surface Cache (6.99.13)
	## Whether the underlying data of an image is stored in RAM, allowing image
	## manipulators to be applied to that image without reloading it from disk.
	## If False, the data is dropped from the cache, but kept as a texture in
	## video memory, reducing RAM usage of the image cache by about half.
	config.cache_surfaces = False

	## --- Image Cache Size (Screens)
	## The size of the image cache, as a multiple of the screen size in pixels.
	config.image_cache_size = None

	## --- Image Cache Size (MB)
	## Used if image_cache_size is None. Each image takes 4 bytes per pixel, or
	## 8 bytes per pixel if `config.cache_surfaces` is enabled.
	config.image_cache_size_mb = 300

	## --- Imagemap Cache
	## If True, imagemap hotspots will be cached to PNG files, reducing time and
	## memory usage, but increasing the size of the game on disk.
	config.imagemap_cache = True

	## --- Screen Cache
	## The number of copies of each screen to keep in the screen cache.
	config.screen_cache_size = 4

## -- Optimization -------------------------------------------------------------

init python:

	## --- Font Preloading
	## A list of TrueType and OpenType font names that Ren'Py should load when
	## starting up. Though this may increase startup time, including fonts here
	## may prevent Ren'Py from pausing when introducing them in-game.
	config.preload_fonts = []

	## --- List Compression
	## How many elements should be in a list before we compress it for rollback.
	config.list_compression_length = 25

	## --- Optimize Image Loading (6.99.14.1)
	## When True, Ren'Py will scan images to find the bounding box of the non-
	## transparent pixels, and only load those pixels into a texture.
	config.optimize_texture_bounds = True

## -- Prediction ---------------------------------------------------------------

init python:

	## --- Condition Switch Prediction
	## The default value used when the predict_all argument for a
	## ConditionSwitch() or ShowingSwitch() displayable is set to None.
	config.conditionswitch_predict_all = False

	## --- Image Prediction
	## Number of statements, including the current one, to consider when doing
	## predictive image loading. A breadth-first search from the current
	## statement is performed until this number of statements is considered, and
	## any image referenced in those statements is potentially predictively
	## loaded. Set this to 0 to disable image prediction.
	config.predict_statements = 10

	## --- (Callbacks) Image Prediction
	## Functions called, without arguments, when predicting images.
	# config.predict_callbacks.append()

	## --- Screen Prediction
	config.predict_screens = True

	## Predict file pages on save/load screen
	config.predict_file_pages = True

	## --- (Callback) Statement Prediction
	## Function that returns a list of statement identifiers that should be
	## predicted. It is called with one argument, the current statement id.
	# config.predict_statements_callback = None

## -- Rendering ----------------------------------------------------------------

init python:

	## --- (Mobile) Hardware Video Playback
	## Whether to use hardware video on supported mobile platforms.
	config.hw_video = False

	## --- OpenGL 2 (7.4.0)
	## Whether to enable and require GL2.
	# config.gl2 = True

	## --- OpenGL Acceleration
	## Whether to use OpenGL acceleration. Note that this will automatically be
	## disabled if it's determined that the system cannot support it.
	## OpenGL can also be disabled by holding down shift at startup.
	config.gl_enable = True

	## --- OpenGL Depth Buffer
	## Bits of depth the game should use, if any.
	config.depth_size = None

## -- Garbage Collection -------------------------------------------------------

init python:

	## Whether Ren'Py manages the Python garbage collector
	config.manage_gc = True

	## The GC thresholds that Ren'Py uses when not idle. These are set to try
	## to ensure that garbage collection doesn't happen. The three numbers are:
	config.gc_thresholds = (25000, 10, 10)

	## The net number of objects that triggers a collection when Ren'Py has
	## reached a steady state.
	config.idle_gc_count = 2500
