			<span class="text-assistive"><h1>Introduction</h1></span>
			<p>{Manual introduction text goes here. You could put a version number in the heading, too, if you want.}</p>

			<p>{You can summarize what your game is about and what gameplay is like here. The Basics section might also be a good place to place character profiles and info about the setting. You could also do an in-depth overview of the in-game menus or give instructions for any unusual features, such as minigames.}</p>

            <h2>Controls</h2>
			Use your mouse or the arrow keys to navigate through menus.
            <ul>

            </ul>

			<h2>Accessibility Features</h2>
			<p>{Your Game} includes some features designed to make the game more accessible. You can toggle them in the Settings menu.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Change the game's default font to DejaVu Sans or OpenDyslexic</li>
				<li>Adjust text box opacity</li>
				<li>Adjust text size and line spacing</li>
				<li>Enable subtitles for important sounds</li>
				<li>Toggle <a href="#Self-Voicing_Mode">self-voicing</a> or <a href="#Clipboard_Voicing_Mode">clipboard voicing</a> mode</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Self-Voicing Mode</h3>
			<p>When self-voicing mode is enabled, in-game text will be read aloud using the default speech synthesis software for your operating system. Self-voicing mode can be toggled either by pressing <kbd>v</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>, or through the preferences menu.</p>

			<p>You can use the keyboard arrows to navigate through and interact with any focusable elements on screen. When an element is focused, the game will announce the text associated with that element. When no element is focused, the game will announce whatever non-focusable text is on screen, such as the dialogue.</p>

			<p>Self-voicing mode is not supported on Android, iOS, or Chrome OS.</p>

			<h4>Speech Settings</h4>
			<h5>Windows</h5>
			<p>Self-voicing on Windows is handled by the Microsoft Speech API. Reading voice and speed can be changed by going to Control Panel, Ease of Access, Speech Recognition, and then selecting Text to Speech. This will open a window called Speech Properties where you can adjust voice settings.</p>

			<h5>Mac</h5>
			<p>Self-voicing on Mac is handled through the "say" command. Speech settings can be adjusted by going to System Preferences. They are located in different locations depending on your OS version:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>10.6 (Snow Leopard) and 10.7 (Lion) Under <strong>Speech</strong>, then the <strong>Text to Speech</strong> tab.</li>
				<li>10.8 (Mountain Lion) through 10.11 (El Capitan): <strong>Dictation & Speech</strong>, then the <strong>Text to Speech</strong> tab.</li>
				<li>10.12 (Sierra) and newer: <strong>Accessibility</strong>, then the <strong>Speech</strong> tab.</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>Linux</h5>
			<p>Self-voicing on Linux is handled using eSpeak. If self-voicing is not working on your system, you may need to install eSpeak using your package manager.</p>

			<h3>Clipboard Voicing Mode</h3>
			<p>If you are using a screenreader that can process text copied to the clipboard, you may prefer to use clipboard voicing mode. Clipboard voicing can be toggled by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> or through the accessibility menu.</p>

			<p>In clipboard voicing mode, when an element is focused using the keyboard or mouse, any text currently associated with that element will be copied to the clipboard. If no element is focused, any non-focusable text on screen, such as dialogue, may be copied to the clipboard instead.</p>

			<h2>Uninstalling the Game</h2>

            <dl class="dl-inline">

			<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
			<p>{Your Game} requires the following minimum specs:</p>
            <dl class="dl-inline">
                <dt>Operating System</dt>
                <dd>Windows XP, Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) 64-bit, or Ubuntu 12.04</dd>
                <br />

                <dt>CPU</dt>
                <dd>Intel&reg; Core&trade;2 Duo Processor @ 2.00 GHz</dd>
                <br />

                <dt>RAM</dt>
                <dd>2.0 GB</dd>
                <br />

                <dt>Graphics</dt>
                <dd>OpenGL 2.0- or DirectX&reg; 9.0c-compatible GPU</dd>
            </dl>
			<h2>Performance Issues</h2>
			<p>You may experience lag if your graphics drivers are out of date or if your system does not adequately support hardware-accelerated graphics.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date.</li>
				<li>Select a new renderer in the Settings menu under <strong>Graphics</strong>. "Auto" will select a renderer best suited for your system, but you may want to try selecting "OpenGL" and finally "ANGLE/DirectX" if you are experiencing lag. Restart the game after changing renderers.</li>
				<li>For low-end systems, videos and animated transitions can be disabled from the Graphics settings screen.</li>
				<li>If playing from a laptop, you may experience better performance by keeping your computer connected to power or optimizing battery settings for performance rather than battery life.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Failing to Launch</h2>
			<p>There are a number of reasons the game may fail to start on your system:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Graphics drivers<dt>
				<dd>In rare cases, an outdated or buggy graphics card driver will cause the game to not launch. Make sure your drivers are up to date before running the game.</dd>

				<dt>File path encoding issues</dt>
				<dd>On Windows systems, the game may not start correctly if it relies on file paths containing characters outside the system's language. You will need to adjust your system locale for non-unicode programs, either through Windows settings or by using a system locale utility such as <a href="https://pooi.moe/Locale-Emulator/">Locale Emulator</a>.</dd>

				<dt>Running on a non-primary display</dt>
				<dd>On Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), you will need to launch the game from the primary display to ensure it starts correctly.</dd>
